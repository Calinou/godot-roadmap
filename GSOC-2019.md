# Google Summer of Code 2019

This is a list of project ideas for students applying to the Google Summer
of Code program (GSoC 2019).

It's only an indicative list, and is subject to change as Godot is very
actively developed by hundreds of contributors. Use this list as an
inspiration source, but feel free to come with your own ideas on what you
would like to work on in Godot.

Make sure to discuss your ideas with Godot developers on the #godotengine-devel
IRC channel (Freenode server), so that we can help you refine your ideas
and ensure that they fit in the Godot roadmap and architecture.

## Java and/or Objective C API Wrappers for Android and iOS

**Skills:** C++, Java, Objective C

Currently, writing wrappers to access code in the Android API is complicated, which makes 
writing add-ons or binding external modules to the platforms more difficult. For iOS it is
a bit less of a pain, but requires Objective C knowledge.

Both Objective C and Java provide introspection APIs (Java does also in C via JNI), which would
allow using the entire platform APIs via GDScript.

It would make it much easier to directly support features of each platform that were not
directly exposed in Godot.

This could be a simple assignature for one student, or two separate ones (for Android and iOS, depending on
skill set and familiarity with the platform).

There is an existing, abandoned effort for Android [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/platform/android/java_class_wrapper.cpp).
